## Overview

The **Kali Intellisense Project** is designed to enhance the user experience for penetration testers using Kali Linux by providing in-terminal IntelliSense-like functionality. This project builds on top of the popular [zsh-autocomplete](https://github.com/marlonrichert/zsh-autocomplete) package, extending its capabilities to offer additional compatibility and features tailored specifically for Kali Linux users.

### Why Kali Intellisense?

As a penetration tester, it‚Äôs challenging to keep up with the constant flow of new tools being developed. On top of that, each tool comes billions and billions and billions... of flags and options, making it even harder to manage everything. The **Kali Intellisense Project** aims to solve this by providing a streamlined autocomplete experience directly within the terminal. It helps users by auto-suggesting tools and flags as they type, significantly reducing the time spent looking up documentation.

## Features

- **Extended Zsh Compatibility**: Builds upon zsh-autocomplete, offering additional support for Kali-specific tools and commands.
